# Karpathy Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Adapted from
[Andrej Karpathy's observations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876)
on LLM coding pitfalls and the upstream MIT-licensed
[karpathy-guidelines skill](https://github.com/multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills/blob/main/skills/karpathy-guidelines/SKILL.md).

> **MANDATORY in Frontier**: These four guidelines are NON-optional for every
> Frontier execution (coding, refactor, review, pipeline). Complete the
> "Self-Check Before Handoff" checklist before any handoff. See the always-on
> rule in `.github/instructions/project-conventions.instructions.md`.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. The only
exemption is a genuinely trivial change (single-line typo, obvious config
rename) whose success criteria are self-evident.

## When to Use

Load this skill when:

- Writing new code or features
- Refactoring or modifying existing code
- Reviewing code (yours or another agent''s)
- Debugging when the cause is not obvious
- Producing pipelines, IaC, or any artifact that ships to production

## Rationalization Table

Reject these shortcuts.

| Rationalization | Reality |
|-----------------|---------|
| "I understand the intent, I can skip stating assumptions." | You only think you understand. State assumptions explicitly so the user can correct the wrong ones cheaply. |
| "I'll add a small abstraction now, it might be useful later." | Speculative abstractions are the leading source of code that is hard to delete. Inline first, abstract on the second real use. |
| "I'll rewrite this whole function, it will be cleaner." | Rewrites import new bugs and break call sites you did not read. Make the smallest surgical change that satisfies the requirement. |
| "The tests pass, so the change is correct." | Passing tests prove the tests pass. They do not prove the change matches the user's intent or the spec. Re-read the request after the code is written. |
| "I'll add error handling for every imaginable failure." | Defensive code for impossible failures hides the real failures and inflates the diff. Validate at boundaries; trust internal invariants. |
| "I'll polish the comments and structure while I'm here." | Drive-by formatting and comment edits hide the real change from the reviewer. Keep the diff focused; open a separate hygiene PR if needed. |
| "The user did not specify, so I'll pick the safer-sounding option." | Silent picks are silent decisions. Either ask, or pick and surface the decision explicitly so it can be reverted. |

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don''t assume. Don''t hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don''t pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what''s confusing. Ask.

**Frontier wiring:** This is the entry gate of every role''s pipeline. The
clarification loop (`docs/WORKFLOW.md#agent-communication-protocol`) exists
precisely so an agent can stop and ask rather than silently guess.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn''t requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios. Validate at boundaries only.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes,
simplify.

**Frontier wiring:** This rule reinforces the existing Implementation
Discipline section in `AGENTS.md`. The
[code-hygiene](../code-hygiene/SKILL.md) skill is the mechanical sweep that
detects violations after the fact - this skill prevents them up front.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don''t "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don''t refactor things that aren''t broken.
- Match existing style, even if you''d do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don''t delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don''t remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

**The test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the user''s request
or the active issue''s acceptance criteria.

**Frontier wiring:** This is what `validate-handoff` is checking when it asks
"do the changed files match the spec scope?" Out-of-scope edits should be
filed as a separate issue, not bundled into the current PR.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform vague tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" -> "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" -> "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" -> "Ensure tests pass before and after"
- "Wire up the pipeline" -> "Run the pipeline end-to-end against a smoke
  fixture; assert exit code 0 and the expected artifact path"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] -> verify: [check]
2. [Step] -> verify: [check]
3. [Step] -> verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let the agent loop independently. Weak criteria
("make it work") require constant clarification and produce drift.

**Frontier wiring:** This is the contract the
[iterative-loop](../iterative-loop/SKILL.md) skill enforces. Every loop
iteration is a verify pass against a stated success criterion. The CLI
hard-gate (`frontier loop complete`) refuses to close the loop until the
criteria pass.

## Self-Check Before Handoff

Before declaring work complete, answer each:

- [ ] Did I state my assumptions and surface ambiguity, or did I guess?
- [ ] Is every line I added or changed traceable to the issue or user request?
- [ ] Did I remove abstractions/options that weren''t asked for?
- [ ] Are my success criteria verifiable (test, command, observable output),
      or vague?
- [ ] Did I touch only my own changes, or did I "improve" unrelated code?

If any answer is "no" or "I don''t know", do not hand off. Loop again.

## Role-Specific Application

| Role | Highest-leverage guideline |
|------|---------------------------|
| Engineer | #2 Simplicity First (most LLM defects come from over-engineering) |
| Reviewer / Auto-Fix Reviewer | #3 Surgical Changes (call out scope creep in PR diffs) |
| Architect | #1 Think Before Coding (ADR is literally "surface tradeoffs") |
| DevOps Engineer | #4 Goal-Driven Execution (pipelines must declare what "green" means) |
| Data Scientist | #4 Goal-Driven Execution (eval baseline = the success criterion) |
| Tester | #4 Goal-Driven Execution (each test IS a verifiable criterion) |

## Anti-Patterns This Skill Prevents

| Anti-Pattern | Karpathy Rule Violated |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Adding `try/except Exception: pass` "just in case" | #2 Simplicity (impossible scenario handling) |
| Refactoring an unrelated module while fixing a bug | #3 Surgical Changes |
| "I''ll assume you meant X" without asking | #1 Think Before Coding |
| "Done" with no test or repro | #4 Goal-Driven Execution |
| Adding a config flag for a single caller | #2 Simplicity (unrequested flexibility) |
| Renaming variables in a security patch PR | #3 Surgical Changes |
| Wrapping a one-line call in a 3-layer abstraction | #2 Simplicity |
