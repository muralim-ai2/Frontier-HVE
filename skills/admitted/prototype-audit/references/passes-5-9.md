# Prototype Audit Passes 5-9

MUST read before running these passes or assigning severity. Follow the root's
evidence and three-cycle loop contract. Recipes do not grant install, commit,
secret-rotation or history-rewrite authority; escalate operations outside scope.

## Pass 5: Routes

For SPAs only. Skip for static HTML.

Check list:

- Every link in the rendered DOM resolves to a known route
- A catch-all `*` route renders a real 404 page (not blank)
- Each route has a unique `<title>`
- Deep-linking works: opening a non-root route directly does not 404 against the static server

Auto-fix recipes:

| Symptom | Recipe |
|---------|--------|
| No `*` route | Add `<Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />` |
| Static host 404 on refresh | Add a SPA rewrite (`/* -> /index.html`) in `vercel.json` / `_redirects` / `staticwebapp.config.json` |
| Missing per-route title | Adopt a `<Helmet>` or `<Title>` component pattern |

## Pass 6: Build hygiene

Check list:

- `npm run build` exits 0 with zero TypeScript errors and zero warnings
- `npm run lint` exits 0
- No `console.log` left in shipped code
- No committed secrets (API keys, tokens) -- scan with the Frontier secret-scan tool
- `package.json` and lockfile are in sync

Auto-fix recipes:

| Symptom | Recipe |
|---------|--------|
| TypeScript error | Fix locally; never disable strict mode for the audit |
| Stray `console.log` | Remove or guard with `if (import.meta.env.DEV)` |
| Lockfile drift | Run `npm install` and commit the updated lock |
| Committed secret | Rotate the secret upstream first, then remove from history |

## Pass 7: Usability heuristics

MUST read [Usability Heuristics](../../usability-heuristics/SKILL.md).

Check list:

- Each of Nielsen H1-H10 inspected against the top 3-5 user tasks
- Every finding scored on the 0-4 severity rubric
- No severity 3 (major) or 4 (catastrophic) finding left unfixed without an explicit accepted waiver
- Content failures (vague errors, missing empty states, jargon) cross-checked against
  [Content Design](../../content-design/SKILL.md), which MUST be read for this check

Auto-fix recipes: defer to the heuristic-specific patterns in
[Usability Heuristics](../../usability-heuristics/SKILL.md). This audit only
enforces that the inspection was run and scored, not how each fix is implemented.

## Pass 8: Visual regression (optional, recommended)

MUST read [Visual Regression](../../visual-regression/SKILL.md).

Skip only when the prototype is a single throwaway HTML file with no iteration planned.

Check list:

- Baselines exist for every primary route at mobile (360), tablet (768), and desktop (1440)
- Playwright `toHaveScreenshot` suite runs to completion with `maxDiffPixelRatio <= 0.01`
- Determinism rules applied (animations disabled, fonts settled, volatile content masked)
- Any baseline update in this audit cycle is reviewable in the PR diff with a justification

Auto-fix recipes:

| Symptom | Recipe |
|---------|--------|
| Animation flake | Add `vr-mode` class + `animations: "disabled"` and re-run |
| Font flake | `await page.evaluate(() => document.fonts.ready)` before screenshot |
| Live data flake | Mask the volatile region with `data-vr-mask` and re-run |
| Intentional layout change | Update baseline with `--update-snapshots`; document in audit report |

## Pass 9: Anti-slop self-critique (pre-emit hard gate)

Before the prototype is emitted for review, MUST read and run the 5-dimension
self-critique from [anti-slop](../../anti-slop/SKILL.md). Each dimension is
scored 1-5; anything under 3/5 on any axis is a P0 hard-gate finding and the
prototype must be revised before Pass 9 is re-run. Anything at 3/5 is a P1
(should-fix). 4/5 and 5/5 are passing.

### Severity convention

Applies to all 10 passes:

- P0 -- hard gate. Prototype is not review-ready until resolved.
- P1 -- should-fix before review unless explicitly waived in the audit
  report with rationale.
- P2 -- nice-to-have. Logged for follow-up.

### The five dimensions

1. Philosophy -- Does the surface have a defended point of view? Generic
   SaaS template = 1. Clearly derived from a brand spec or visual direction
   = 5.
2. Hierarchy -- Can a first-time viewer name the primary action within
   one second? Every element competing = 1. One CTA wins decisively = 5.
3. Execution -- Spacing, alignment, contrast, and typography quality.
   Default Tailwind everywhere with no scale = 1. Disciplined tokens and
   intentional rhythm = 5.
4. Specificity -- Does the prototype use real (or honestly-placeholder)
   content and product-specific concepts? Lorem ipsum + stock metrics = 1.
   Product-true content with cited placeholders = 5.
5. Restraint -- Did the build avoid the tells Pass 0 cannot see? Scope
   this to the Frontier-retained set: emoji as iconography (T2), fabricated
   metrics and testimonials (T3), unearned trust badges (T8), and
   emoji-prefixed headings (T10), plus judgement-only glassmorphism,
   hierarchy, and composition concerns. Visual tells with a deterministic
   rule, including extreme radius and hand-drawn SVG, are Pass 0's job -- do
   not re-litigate them here. Any retained violation present unwaived = 1.
   None present = 5.

### Procedure

1. Confirm Pass 0 status. Run the Frontier-retained tell check (T2, T3, T8,
   T10) and the honest-placeholders check. If Pass 0 was `DEGRADED`, also
   run the full T1-T10 list, since no deterministic rule covered them.
2. Score each of the five dimensions 1-5 with a one-line justification
   each.
3. If a brand-spec exists for the issue, score against the brand-spec
   prohibited-patterns list, not generic taste.
4. Any dimension below 3/5 = P0; fix and re-run from step 1.
5. Record final scores and justifications in the audit report under
   "Pass 9: Anti-slop self-critique".

Maximum three revision cycles before escalating to the user.
